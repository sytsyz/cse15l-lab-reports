## Lab Report 4

Hi dear grader:

I am having on and off fevers due to temperature drops and do not think I have the energy to complete this assignmnet. 
I have sent emails to professor Joe asking for extention, but he had not responsed me yet. I am wondering if it's okay 
to just submit like this and wait for the resubmit to complete it?

Sincerely,
Yutong She
