## Part 1 Bugs
Chosen bug: ReversedInPlace
1. A failure-inducing input 
```
@Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace2()
  {
    int[] input1 = { 1,2,7 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 7,2,1 }, input1);
	}
```
2. An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure
```
@Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace3()
  {
    int[] input1 = { };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ }, input1);
	}
```
3. Symptoms

   - no failure input

4. The Bug
   - Before
   ```
   // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
    static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) 
    {
      for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) 
      {
        arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      }
    }
   ```
   - After
   ```
   // Changes the input array to be in reversed order
   static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) 
    {
      for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) 
      {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
        arr[arr.length-i-1] = temp;
      }
    }
   ```
  - Explanation
    The original code did not fulfill the fuction of reserve the input, it simply rewrite the array in the beginning by the number at the end of the array.
    As a result, the original code will have an output which an array that contains only the last number in the array. The fix address this issue. By adding a temperory
    number holder "temp", the code is now able to store the original number before it get rewrite by the last number of the array, then able to put this temp number towards
    the last places of the array.

## Part 2 Researching Commands: Gerp
1. -r
- directory
```
linda@Yutongs-MacBook-Pro technical % grep -r "Darwin" biomed
biomed/1471-2105-3-2.txt:        In the 1830's, Charles Darwin's investigation of the
biomed/1471-2105-3-2.txt:        In the 1970's, Woese and Fox revisited Darwinian
   r stands for recursive. grep -r search all things containg keword (in this case "Darwin") of the working directory and its sub directories.
```
r stands for recursive. Shen applied to directory, it searches all the files that contains the keyword "Darwin" biomed and its subdirectory, displaying the pathway to the files and the lines in which the keywords is contained. 

- files
```
linda@Yutongs-MacBook-Pro biomed % grep -r "Darwin" 1471-2105-3-2.txt 
1471-2105-3-2.txt:        In the 1830's, Charles Darwin's investigation of the
1471-2105-3-2.txt:        In the 1970's, Woese and Fox revisited Darwinian
```
r stands for recursive. Shen applied to file, it searches all the files that contains the keyword "Darwin" in working directory, displaying the name of the files and the lines in which the keywords is contained. 

2. -w
- Files
 ```
   linda@Yutongs-MacBook-Pro biomed % grep -w "Darwin" 1471-2105-3-2.txt
        In the 1830's, Charles Darwin's investigation of the
linda@Yutongs-MacBook-Pro biomed % grep  "Darwin" 1471-2105-3-2.txt 
        In the 1830's, Charles Darwin's investigation of the
        In the 1970's, Woese and Fox revisited Darwinian
 ```
- Directory
  ```
  linda@Yutongs-MacBook-Pro biomed % grep -w "Darwin" biomed
  grep: biomed: No such file or directory
  ```
